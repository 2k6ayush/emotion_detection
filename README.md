# emotion_detection
This Python script uses OpenCV to access your webcam and the DeepFace library to detect and display the dominant emotion on your face in real-time. As it runs, it continuously analyzes each webcam frame, identifies the prevailing emotion (such as happy, sad, angry, etc.), and overlays the result on the video. Press 'q' to exit the application.
